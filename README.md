For this prototype version, if you press or hold the button, brightness will change in 4 levels.
ATTENTION:
    - If you plan to use a battery, be sure to provide 5v and enough current (still don't know the exact values)
    - If you are using an usb cable plugged to a laptop or computer, that should be enough
